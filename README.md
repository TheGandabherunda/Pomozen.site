**Pomozen** is a modern, open-source **Pomodoro timer** available as both a **mobile app** and a **website**.
It applies the Pomodoro Technique—structuring work into focused intervals (typically 25 minutes) followed by short breaks.
This approach helps combat mental fatigue, maintain concentration, and improve efficiency in work or study.
